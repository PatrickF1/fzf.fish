Augment your [Fish][] command line with mnemonic key bindings to efficiently find what you need using [fzf][].

## Features

Use `fzf.fish` to interactively find and insert the shell entities listed below into your command line. <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select multiple entries. If you trigger a search while your command line cursor is touching a word, that word will be used to seed the fzf query and will be replaced by your selection. All searches include a preview of the entity hovered over so you can seamlessly determine if it's what you're looking for. The previews also make fzf.fish a handy browsing tool.

### File paths

![gif directory](../assets/directory.gif)

- **Search input:** recursive listing of current directory's non-hidden files
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (`F` for file)
- **Preview window:** file with syntax highlighting, directory contents, or file type
- **Remarks**
  - appends `/` to directories selected so you can hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to [immediately cd into it][cd docs] if it is the only token on the command line
  - if the current token is a directory with a trailing slash (e.g. `.config/<CURSOR>`), then that directory is searched instead
  - [ignores files that are also ignored by git](#fd-gi)

### Modified paths

![gif git status](../assets/git_status.gif)

- **Search input:** the current repository's `git status`
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (`S` for status)
- **Preview window:** the git diff of the file

### Commit hashes

![gif git log](../assets/git_log.gif)

- **Search input:** the current repository's formatted `git log`
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> (`L` for log)
- **Preview window:** commit message and diff

### A previously run command

![gif command history](../assets/command_history.gif)

- **Search input:** Fish's command history
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> (`R` for reverse-i-search)
- **Preview window:** the entire command with Fish syntax highlighting

### Shell variables

![gif shell variables](../assets/shell_variables.gif)

- **Search input:** all the variable names of the environment currently [in scope][var scope]
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (`V` for variable)
- **Preview window:** the scope info and values of the variable
- `$history` is excluded for technical reasons so use the [search command history](#a-previously-run-command) feature instead to inspect it

### Process ids

![gif processes](../assets/processes.gif)

- **Search input:** the pid and command of all running processes, outputted by `ps`
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (`P` for process)
- **Preview window:** the CPU usage, memory usage, start time, and other information about the process

_The prompt used in the screencasts was created using [IlanCosman/tide](https://github.com/IlanCosman/tide)._

## Installation

First, install a proper version of these CLI dependencies:

| CLI      | Minimum version required | Description                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| [fish][] | 3.2.0                    | a modern shell                                 |
| [fzf][]  | 0.27.2                   | fuzzy finder that powers this plugin           |
| [fd][]   | 8.3.0                    | faster and more colorful alternative to `find` |
| [bat][]  | 0.16.0                   | smarter `cat` with syntax highlighting         |

The search directory feature uses [fd][] and [bat][] to list and preview files. If your package manager [doesn't install them as `fd` and `bat`](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/wiki/Troubleshooting#search-directory-feature-does-not-work) respectively, then you can symlink them to those names.

Next, install this plugin with [Fisher][].

> `fzf.fish` can be installed manually or with other plugin managers but only Fisher is officially supported.

```fish
fisher install PatrickF1/fzf.fish
```

## Configuration

### Customize key bindings

`fzf.fish` includes an ergonomic wrapper for configuring its key bindings. Read its documentation with this command:

```fish
fzf_configure_bindings --help
```

Once you've determined the desired `fzf_configure_bindings` command, add it to your `config.fish` in order to persist the bindings.

### Always pass some options to fzf

fzf supports setting default options via the [FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables) environment variable. If it is set, fzf implicitly prepends it to the options passed to it on every execution, scripted and interactive.

By default, `fzf.fish` will set a sane `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` every time before it executes fzf. However, if you export your own `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` variable, then `fzf.fish` will forgo setting it and yours will be used instead. See [functions/\_fzf_wrapper.fish](functions/_fzf_wrapper.fish) for more details.

### Pass fzf options for a specific feature

The following variables can store custom options that will be passed to fzf by their respective feature:

| Feature                | Variable              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Search directory       | `fzf_dir_opts`        |
| Search git status      | `fzf_git_status_opts` |
| Search git log         | `fzf_git_log_opts`    |
| Search command history | `fzf_history_opts`    |
| Search shell variables | `fzf_shell_vars_opts` |
| Search processes       | `fzf_processes_opts`  |

They are always appended last to fzf's argument list. Because fzf uses the option appearing last when options conflict, your custom options can override hardcoded options. Custom fzf options unlocks a variety of possibilities in customizing and augmenting each feature such as:

- add [key bindings](https://www.mankier.com/1/fzf#Key/Event_Bindings) within fzf to operate on the selected line:
  - [open file in Vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1360)
  - [preview image files](https://gitter.im/junegunn/fzf?at=5947962ef6a78eab48620792)
  - [copy to clipboard](https://betterprogramming.pub/boost-your-command-line-productivity-with-fuzzy-finder-985aa162ba5d)
  - git checkout commit
  - git reset file
- adjust the preview command or window
- [re-populate fzf's input list on demand](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750)
- change the search mode

### Change the commands used to preview directories and regular files

The search directory feature, by default, calls `ls` to preview directories and `bat` to preview [regular files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6858452).

To change the directory preview command (e.g. to use one of the many `ls` replacements such as `exa`), set the command in the `fzf_preview_dir_cmd` variable:

```fish
set fzf_preview_dir_cmd exa --all --color=always
```

And to change the file preview command (e.g. to `cat` to avoid installing a new dependency, or to add custom logic such as image preview), set the command in the `fzf_preview_file_cmd` variable:

```fish
set fzf_preview_file_cmd cat
```

Omit the target path for both variables as `fzf.fish` will itself [specify the target to preview](functions/_fzf_preview_file.fish#L7).

### Change the files searched

To pass custom options to `fd` when it is executed to populate the list of files for the search directory feature, set the `fzf_fd_opts` variable. For example, to include hidden files but not `.git`, put this in your `config.fish`:

```fish
set fzf_fd_opts --hidden --exclude=.git
```

<a id='fd-gi'></a>By default, `fd` hides files listed in `.gitignore`. You can disable this behavior by adding the `--no-ignore` flag to `fzf_fd_opts`.
