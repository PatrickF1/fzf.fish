Augment your [Fish][] command line with mnemonic key bindings to efficiently find what you need using [fzf][].

## Search commands

Use `fzf.fish` to interactively find and insert file paths, git commit hashes, and other entities into your command line. <kbd>Tab</kbd> to select multiple entries. If you trigger a search while your cursor is on a word, that word will be used to seed the fzf query and will be replaced by your selection. All searches include a preview of the entity hovered over to help you find what you're looking for.

### üìÅ Search Directory

![Search Directory example](../assets/directory.png)

- **Fzf input:** recursive listing of current directory's non-hidden files
- **Output:** relative paths of selected files
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (`F` for file)
- **Preview window:** file with syntax highlighting, directory contents, or file type
- **Remarks**
  - directories are inserted with a trailing `/`, so if you select exactly one directory, you can immediately hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to [cd into it][cd docs]
  - if the current token is a directory with a trailing slash (e.g. `.config/<CURSOR>`), then that directory is searched instead
  - [ignores files that are also ignored by git](#fd-gi)

### ü™µ Search Git Log

![Search Git Log example](../assets/git_log.png)

- **Fzf input:** the current repository's formatted `git log`
- **Output:** hashes of selected commits
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> (`L` for log)
- **Preview window:** commit message and diff

### üìù Search Git Status

![Search Git Status example](../assets/git_status.png)

- **Fzf input:** the current repository's `git status`
- **Output:** relative paths of selected lines
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (`S` for status)
- **Preview window:** the git diff of the file

### üìú Search History

![Search History example](../assets/history.png)

- **Fzf input:** Fish's command history
- **Output:** selected commands
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> (`R` for reverse-i-search)
- **Preview window:** the entire command with Fish syntax highlighting

### üñ•Ô∏è Search Processes

![Search Processes example](../assets/processes.png)

- **Fzf input:** the pid and command of all running processes, outputted by `ps`
- **Output:** pids of selected processes
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd> (`P` for process)
- **Preview window:** the CPU usage, memory usage, start time, and other information about the process

### üí≤ Search Variables

![Search Variables example](../assets/variables.png)

- **Fzf input:** all the shell variables currently [in scope][var scope]
- **Output:** selected shell variables
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (`V` for variable)
- **Preview window:** the variable's scope info and values
- `$history` is excluded for technical reasons so use [Search History](#-search-history) instead to inspect it

## Installation

First, install a proper version of these CLI dependencies:

| CLI      | Minimum version required | Description                             |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| [fish][] | 3.4.0                    | a modern shell                          |
| [fzf][]  | 0.27.2                   | fuzzy finder that powers this plugin    |
| [fd][]   | 8.5.0                    | faster, colorized alternative to `find` |
| [bat][]  | 0.16.0                   | smarter `cat` with syntax highlighting  |

[fd][] and [bat][] only need to be installed if you will use [Search Directory][].

Next, because `fzf.fish` is incompatible with other fzf plugins, [check for and remove these two common alternatives](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/wiki/Uninstalling-other-fzf-plugins).

Finally, install this plugin with [Fisher][].

> `fzf.fish` can be installed manually or with other plugin managers but only Fisher is officially supported.

```fish
fisher install PatrickF1/fzf.fish
```

## Configuration

### Customize key bindings

`fzf.fish` includes an ergonomic wrapper for configuring its key bindings. Read [its documentation](/functions/_fzf_configure_bindings_help.fish) with this command:

```fish
fzf_configure_bindings --help
```

Once you've determined the desired `fzf_configure_bindings` command, add it to your `config.fish` in order to persist the bindings.

### Always pass some options to fzf

fzf supports global default options via the [FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables) environment variable. If set, fzf implicitly prepends its value to the options it receives on every execution, scripted and interactive.

`fzf.fish` locally sets [a sane `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` whenever it executes fzf](functions/_fzf_wrapper.fish). If you export your own `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS`, then yours will be used instead.

### Pass fzf options for a specific command

The following variables can store custom options that will be passed to fzf by their respective command:

| Command           | Variable              |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Search Directory  | `fzf_directory_opts`  |
| Search Git Log    | `fzf_git_log_opts`    |
| Search Git Status | `fzf_git_status_opts` |
| Search History    | `fzf_history_opts`    |
| Search Processes  | `fzf_processes_opts`  |
| Search Variables  | `fzf_variables_opts`  |

They are appended last to fzf's options list. Because fzf uses the last instance of an option if it is specified multiple times, custom options will always take precedence. Custom fzf options unlock a variety of customizations and augmentations such as:

- add [key bindings](https://www.mankier.com/1/fzf#Key/Event_Bindings) within fzf to operate on the selected line:
  - [open file in Vim](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/pull/273)
  - [preview image files](https://gitter.im/junegunn/fzf?at=5947962ef6a78eab48620792)
  - git reset file
- adjust the preview command or window
- [re-populate fzf's input list on demand](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750)
- change the [search mode](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#search-syntax)

Find more ideas and implementation tips in the [Cookbook](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/wiki/Cookbook).

### Change how Search Directory previews directories and regular files

[Search Directory][], by default, calls `ls` to preview directories and `bat` to preview [regular files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6858452).

To use your own directory preview command (e.g. to use one of the many `ls` replacements such as `exa`), set it in `fzf_preview_dir_cmd`:

```fish
set fzf_preview_dir_cmd exa --all --color=always
```

And to use your own file preview command (e.g. to `cat` to avoid having to install `bat`, or to add logic for previewing images), set it in `fzf_preview_file_cmd`:

```fish
set fzf_preview_file_cmd cat -n
```

Omit the target path for both variables as `fzf.fish` will itself [specify the argument to preview](functions/_fzf_preview_file.fish).

### Change what files are listed in Search Directory

To pass custom options to `fd` when it is executed to populate the list of files for [Search Directory][], set them in `fzf_fd_opts`. For example, this includes hidden files but not `.git`:

```fish
set fzf_fd_opts --hidden --exclude=.git
```

<a id='fd-gi'></a>By default, `fd` hides files listed in `.gitignore`. You can disable this behavior by adding the `--no-ignore` flag to `fzf_fd_opts`.

### Change the commit formatting used by Search Git Log

[Search Git Log][] calls `git log --format` to format the list of commits. To use your own [commit log format](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#Documentation/git-log.txt-emnem), set it in `fzf_git_log_format`. For example, this shows the hash and subject for each commit:

```fish
set fzf_git_log_format "%H %s"
```

The format must be one line per commit and the hash must be the first field, or else Search Git Log will fail to determine which commits you selected.

### Change the date time format used by Search History

[Search History][] shows the date and time each command was executed. To change how the date and time are formatted, set your [strftime format string](https://devhints.io/strftime) in `fzf_history_time_format`.
Do not to use the vertical box-drawing character `‚îÇ`, as it is used to delineate the date and time from the command.
