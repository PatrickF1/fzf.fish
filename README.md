</div>

Augment your [Fish][] command line with mnemonic key bindings to efficiently find what you need using [fzf][].

## Features

Use `fzf.fish` to interactively find and insert different shell entities into the command line:

### File paths

![file search][]

- **Search input:** recursive listing of current directory's non-hidden files
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> (`F` for file)
- **Preview window:** file with syntax highlighting, directory contents, or file type
- **Remarks**
  - appends `/` to the selection if it is a directory and the only path selected, making it quick to cd into (see [cd docs][])
  - if the current token is a directory with a trailing slash (e.g. `.config/<CURSOR>`), then that directory is searched instead
  - ignores files that are also ignored by git
  - <kbd>Tab</kbd> to multi-select

### Modified paths

![git status select][]

- **Search input:** the current repository's `git status`
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> (`S` for status)
- **Remarks:** <kbd>Tab</kbd> to multi-select

### A commit hash

![git log search][]

- **Search input:** the current repository's formatted `git log`
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> (`L` for log)
- **Preview window:** commit message and diff

### A previously run command

![command history search][]

- **Search input:** the command history from all interactive sessions of Fish
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> (`R` for reverse-i-search)
- **Preview window:** the entire command, wrapped

### A shell variable

![shell variables search][]

- **Search input:** all the variable names of the environment currently [in scope][var scope]
- **Key binding and mnemonic:** <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (`V` for variable)
- **Preview window:** the scope info and values of the variable
- **Remarks**
  - `$history` is excluded for technical reasons so use the search command history feature instead to inspect it

## Installation

First, install a proper version of these CLIs:

| CLI      | Minimum version required | Description                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [fish][] | 3.2.0                    | a modern shell                                    |
| [fzf][]  | 0.27.2                   | command-line fuzzy finder that powers this plugin |
| [fd][]   | 7.5.0                    | much faster and friendlier alternative to `find`  |
| [bat][]  | 0.16.0                   | smarter `cat` with syntax highlighting            |

On certain distribution of Linux, you need to alias `fdfind` to `fd` (see [#93](https://github.com/PatrickF1/fzf.fish/discussions/93)).

Next, install this plugin with [Fisher][].

> `fzf.fish` can be installed manually or with other plugin managers but only Fisher is officially supported.

```fish
fisher install PatrickF1/fzf.fish
```

## Configuration

### Customize key bindings

`fzf.fish` includes a convenient wrapper for configuring its key bindings. It comes with command completions and is thoroughly documented. See

```fish
fzf_configure_bindings --help
```

Once you've found the `fzf_configure_bindings` command that produces the desired bindings, add it to your `config.fish` in order to persist the bindings.

### Pass fzf options to all commands

fzf supports setting default options via the [FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS][] environment variable. If it is set, fzf implicitly prepends it to the options passed to it on every execution, scripted and interactive.

To make fzf's interface friendlier, `fzf.fish` takes the liberty of setting a sane `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` if it is not already set. See [conf.d/fzf.fish][] for more details. This affects fzf even outside of this plugin. If you would like to remove this side effect or just want to customize fzf's default options, then set export your own `FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS` variable. For example:

```fish
set --export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS --height 50% --no-extended +i
```

### Pass fzf options to a specific command

The following variables can store custom options that will be passed to fzf by their respective feature:

| Feature                | Variable              |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Search directory       | `fzf_dir_opts`        |
| Search git status      | `fzf_git_status_opts` |
| Search git log         | `fzf_git_log_opts`    |
| Search command history | `fzf_history_opts`    |
| Search shell variables | `fzf_shell_vars_opts` |

They are always appended last to fzf's argument list. Because fzf uses the option appearing last when options conflict, your custom options can override hardcoded options. Custom fzf options unlocks a variety of possibilities in customizing and augmenting each feature such as:

- add [key bindings](https://www.mankier.com/1/fzf#Key/Event_Bindings) within fzf to operate on the selected line:
  - [open file in Vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1360)
  - [preview image files](https://gitter.im/junegunn/fzf?at=5947962ef6a78eab48620792)
  - [copy to clipboard](https://betterprogramming.pub/boost-your-command-line-productivity-with-fuzzy-finder-985aa162ba5d)
  - git checkout commit
  - git reset file
- adjust the preview command or window
- [re-populate fzf's input list on demand](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/issues/1750)
- change the search mode

### Change the command used to preview files

The search directory feature, by default, uses `bat` to preview the contents of files. `bat` is a well-adopted `cat` replacement with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and more. If you would like to change the preview tool (to `cat` to avoid installing a new dependency, or to add custom logic such as binary or image preview), you may set the `fzf_preview_file_cmd` variable. For example, in your `config.fish`, you may put:

```fish
set fzf_preview_file_cmd cat
```

Do not specify a target path in the command, as `fzf.fish` will [prepend the file][custom preview command] to preview to the command itself.

### Change the command used to preview directories

The search directory feature, by default, uses `ls` to preview the contents of directories. To integrate with the variety of `ls` replacements available (e.g. exa, lsd, tree), the command used to preview directories is configurable through the `fzf_preview_dir_cmd` variable. Set `fzf_preview_dir_cmd` in your `config.fish`:

```fish
set fzf_preview_dir_cmd exa --all --color=always
```

As above, do not specify a target path in the command. `fzf.fish` will [prepend the directory][custom preview command] to preview to the command itself.

### Change the files searched

To pass custom options to `fd` when it is executed to populate the list of files for the search directory feature, set the `fzf_fd_opts` variable. For example, to include hidden files but not `.git`, put this in your `config.fish`:

```fish
set fzf_fd_opts --hidden --exclude=.git
```
